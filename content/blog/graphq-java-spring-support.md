We are happy to release the first version of the GraphQL Java Spring (Boot) project.

As [described before](https://www.graphql-java.com/blog/graphql-java-aims-to-be-used-directly/) this project
complements the GraphQL Java core project if you build a fully operational GraphQL server with Spring.

Currently it supports GET and POST requests and allows for some basic customization.  

In future we are looking into supporting more advanced features like file upload or subscriptions.

As always contributions are more than welcome and we are hoping to grow this project together with the 
community: please open a new issue or leave a comment on [spectrum chat](https://spectrum.chat/graphql-java) about your wishes.

More details on how to use it can be found on the github page: https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java-spring
