We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java 20.0!

Special thanks to each of the 200+ contributors over the years, who have made this milestone possible.

We've added support for record-like property fetching, added performance improvements for `PropertyDataFetcher` and reduced object allocation.

Version 20 also introduces internationalization (i18n) for validation, parsing, and scalar coercion [error messages](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/tree/master/src/main/resources/i18n). We have added German translations, and we would love to see more languages. If you would like to contribute, please open a pull request.
