We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v21.0! Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release, whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in discussions.

And a very Happy 8th Birthday to graphql-java, who celebrated their birthday last week!

This is a **breaking change** release, including upgrading to Java 11 and changes to `parseValue` coercion. See the full release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v21.0).
